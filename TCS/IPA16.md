Create a class NavalVessel with the below attributes:

vesselld – int
vesselName – String
noOfVoyagesPlanned – int
noOfVoyagesCompleted – int
purpose – String


Write getters, setters for the above attributes. Create constructor which takes parameter in the above 
sequence except classification.

Create class Solution with main method. Implement two static methods – findAvgVoyagesByPct and findVesselByGrade 
in Solution class.

findAvgVoyagesByPct method:

This method will take two input parameters -array of NavalVessel objects and int parameter percentage. The method will 
return the average of the noOfVoyagesCompleted attribute from NavalVessel objects which meets the percentage requirement 
as mentioned below.The percentage for each navalVessel is calculated as 
percentage .(noOfVoyagesCompleted * 100)/noOfVoyagesPlanned. If the above calculated percentage is greater than or equal 
to the percentage passed as the parameter, then those objects should participate in the average calculation. If there are 
no objects with the mentioned criteria, then the method should return 0.

findVesselByGrade method:

This method will take a String parameter purpose, along with the array of NavalVessel objects. The method will return the 
NavalVessel object, if the input String parameter matches with the purpose attribute of the NavalVessel object. Before 
returning the object, the classification should be derived as mentioned below. This classification value should be assigned 
to the object before returning. If any of the above conditions are not met, then the method should return null. The 
classification attribute should be calculated based on the percentage calculation mentioned above. 
If the percentage = 100 then classification should be ‘Star’, if percentage is between 99 and 80 then classification should 
be ‘Leader, if percentage is between 79 and 55 then classification should be ‘Inspirer' otherwise the classification should 
be ‘Striver’ If the returned value is null then it should print “No Naval Vessel is available with the specified purpose”.

Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four NavalVessel objects referring 
attributes in the above mentioned attribute sequence (except the classification attribute). Next, read the value for 
percentage and purpose.

Here is the solution to the problem.

**NavalVessel Class**
```java
public class NavalVessel {
    private int vesselld;
    private String vesselName;
    private int noOfVoyagesPlanned;
    private int noOfVoyagesCompleted;
    private String purpose;

    // Getters
    public int getVesselld() {
        return vesselld;
    }

    public String getVesselName() {
        return vesselName;
    }

    public int getNoOfVoyagesPlanned() {
        return noOfVoyagesPlanned;
    }

    public int getNoOfVoyagesCompleted() {
        return noOfVoyagesCompleted;
    }

    public String getPurpose() {
        return purpose;
    }

    // Setters
    public void setVesselld(int vesselld) {
        this.vesselld = vesselld;
    }

    public void setVesselName(String vesselName) {
        this.vesselName = vesselName;
    }

    public void setNoOfVoyagesPlanned(int noOfVoyagesPlanned) {
        this.noOfVoyagesPlanned = noOfVoyagesPlanned;
    }

    public void setNoOfVoyagesCompleted(int noOfVoyagesCompleted) {
        this.noOfVoyagesCompleted = noOfVoyagesCompleted;
    }

    public void setPurpose(String purpose) {
        this.purpose = purpose;
    }

    // Constructor
    public NavalVessel(int vesselld, String vesselName, int noOfVoyagesPlanned, int noOfVoyagesCompleted, String purpose) {
        this.vesselld = vesselld;
        this.vesselName = vesselName;
        this.noOfVoyagesPlanned = noOfVoyagesPlanned;
        this.noOfVoyagesCompleted = noOfVoyagesCompleted;
        this.purpose = purpose;
    }
}
```

**Solution Class**
```java
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Read inputs using Scanner
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        NavalVessel[] vessels = new NavalVessel[4];
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int vesselld = scanner.nextInt();
            String vesselName = scanner.next();
            int noOfVoyagesPlanned = scanner.nextInt();
            int noOfVoyagesCompleted = scanner.nextInt();

            vessels[i] = new NavalVessel(vesselld, vesselName, noOfVoyagesPlanned, noOfVoyagesCompleted, purpose);
        }
        int percentage = scanner.nextInt();
        String purposeGrade = scanner.next();

        // Call static methods
        double avgVoyages = findAvgVoyagesByPct(vessels, percentage);
        NavalVessel vesselGrade = findVesselByGrade(purposeGrade, vessels);

        // Print outputs
        System.out.println(avgVoyages);
        if (vesselGrade != null) {
            System.out.println(vesselGrade.getVesselName() + "%" + getGrade(vesselGrade));
        } else {
            System.out.println("No Naval Vessel is available with the specified purpose");
        }
    }

    // findAvgVoyagesByPct method
    public static double findAvgVoyagesByPct(NavalVessel[] vessels, int percentage) {
        int sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (NavalVessel vessel : vessels) {
            int planned = vessel.getNoOfVoyagesPlanned();
            int completed = vessel.getNoOfVoyagesCompleted();
            int percentageCalculated = (int) ((completed * 100.0) / planned);
            if (percentageCalculated >= percentage) {
                sum += completed;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count > 0 ? (double) sum / count : 0;
    }

    // findVesselByGrade method
    public static NavalVessel findVesselByGrade(String purpose, NavalVessel[] vessels) {
        for (NavalVessel vessel : vessels) {
            if (purpose.equals(vessel.getPurpose())) {
                int planned = vessel.getNoOfVoyagesPlanned();
                int completed = vessel.getNoOfVoyagesCompleted();
                int percentageCalculated = (int) ((completed * 100.0) / planned);
                String grade = getGrade(percentageCalculated);
                vessel.setClassification(grade);
                return vessel;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }

    // getGrade method
    private static String getGrade(int percentage) {
        if (percentage == 100) {
            return "Star";
        } else if (percentage >= 99 && percentage <= 80) {
            return "Leader";
        } else if (percentage >= 79 && percentage <= 55) {
            return "Inspirer";
        } else {
            return "Striver";
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation**

* The `NavalVessel` class has five attributes: `vesselld`, `vesselName`, `noOfVoyagesPlanned`, `noOfVoyagesCompleted`, and `purpose`. It also has getters and setters for these attributes, as well as a constructor that takes these attributes as parameters.
* The `Solution` class has two static methods: `findAvgVoyagesByPct` and `findVesselByGrade`.
* The `findAvgVoyagesByPct` method takes an array of `NavalVessel` objects and an integer `percentage` as input. It calculates the percentage of completed voyages for each vessel and returns the average of the completed voyages for the vessels that meet the percentage requirement.
* The `findVesselByGrade` method takes a string `purpose` and an array of `NavalVessel` objects as input. It finds the vessel that matches the specified purpose and returns it. Before returning the vessel, it calculates the classification of the vessel based on its percentage of completed voyages and assigns it to the vessel.
* In the `main` method, we read the inputs using a `Scanner` object and create an array of `NavalVessel` objects. We then call the static methods and print the outputs.
* The `getGrade` method is a helper method that calculates the grade based on the percentage of completed voyages.
