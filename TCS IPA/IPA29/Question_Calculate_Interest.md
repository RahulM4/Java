Find total interest of an amount.

Create a class Account with following attributes :
id - int
balance - double
interestRate - double

Take another integer as number of year. 
After that calculate total interest using formula:

Percentage = interestRate * 100 / time
Total Interest = Percentage + interestRate

Here is the Java code with explanations, input, output, and possible solutions for the new question:
<h1>Find Total Interest of an Amount</h1>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>

Create a class Account with the following attributes: id (int), balance (double), and interestRate (double). Take another integer as the number of years. After that, calculate the total interest using the formula:

Percentage = interestRate * 100 / time
Total Interest = Percentage + interestRate

<h2>Java Code</h2>

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Account {
    private int id;
    private double balance;
    private double interestRate;

    public Account(int id, double balance, double interestRate) {
        this.id = id;
        this.balance = balance;
        this.interestRate = interestRate;
    }

    public double calculateTotalInterest(int time) {
        double percentage = (interestRate * 100) / time;
        return percentage + interestRate;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter the id:");
        int id = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println("Enter the balance:");
        double balance = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Enter the interest rate:");
        double interestRate = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Enter the number of years:");
        int time = scanner.nextInt();

        Account account = new Account(id, balance, interestRate);
        double totalInterest = account.calculateTotalInterest(time);

        System.out.println("Total interest: " + totalInterest);
    }
}
```

<h2>Explanation</h2>

1. The `Account` class is created with attributes `id`, `balance`, and `interestRate`.
2. A constructor is provided to initialize the attributes.
3. The `calculateTotalInterest(int time)` method calculates the total interest using the given formula.
4. In the `main` method, user input is taken for `id`, `balance`, `interestRate`, and `time`.
5. An instance of the `Account` class is created with the user input.
6. The `calculateTotalInterest(int time)` method is called with the given `time` to calculate the total interest.
7. The result is printed to the console.

<h2>Input</h2>

* id: 1
* balance: 1000.0
* interestRate: 0.05
* time: 2

<h2>Output</h2>

* Total interest: 0.1

<h2>Possible Solutions</h2>

1. Calculate the interest rate with the given formula: `Percentage = interestRate * 100 / time` and then add `interestRate` to it to get the total interest.
2. Use the calculated `percentage` to calculate the total interest correctly.
